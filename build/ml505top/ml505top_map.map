Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice LUTs:                          9 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                        9 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:               9

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     7 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            9
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             9 out of       9  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       9    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of       9    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        19 out of     640    2%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       19 out of      19  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
  Number of DSP48Es:                             1 out of      64    1%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.57

Peak Memory Usage:  1024 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  34 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   33 secs
